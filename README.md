## Project Description

This tool leverages publicly available research, community contributions, and user-generated insights to create a dynamic visualization of aspartame-related data. Users can:
- Explore correlations between aspartame consumption and various health metrics.
- View data trends and insights through interactive graphs and charts.
- Contribute new data sets or suggest improvements to visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Users can explore visualizations that showcase trends and correlations between aspartame and health metrics (e.g., diabetes rates, neurological impacts).
- **Filterable Data**: View data by region, age group, consumption levels, and more.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Contributors can add new datasets or update existing ones, keeping the visualizations current.
- **Export Options**: Download graphs or raw data for use in research or presentations.
- **API Integration**: Developers can use an API to retrieve and utilize the data.
